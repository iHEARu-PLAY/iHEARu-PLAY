# iHEARu-PLAY - the intelligent gamified crowdsourcing platform

iHEARu-PLAY, is a web-based multiplayer game for crowdsourced database collection and annotation. The platform offers audio, video, and image labelling for a diverse range of annotation tasks as well as audio-visual data collections. In addition, the platform ensures a high quality of annotations through an optimised data quality management, while the gamification aspect reduces the mental boredom of the annotators. Making use of the data quality management, user trustability-based machine learning algorithms are integrated resulting in an intelligent way of gathering annotations and at the same time reducing the manual annotation workload.
